Period pieces rely heavily on the soundtrack for immersion. The sounds of a movie set the auditory backdrop and allow you to fully engross yourself in the time period. With that being said, when the music starkly clashes with the time period, I find my attention fully focused on the character and their actions.</description></item><item><title>straight outta atl</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/sp-11-11-20/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Nov 2020 19:53:52 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/sp-11-11-20/</guid><description>Despite the east coast provenance of the hip hop scene, the southern lab has established itself as the genre&amp;rsquo;s powerhouse multiple times over the hop hop timeline. More recently, the trap artists coming out of ATL have taken the world by storm and finally cemented rap as the mainstream sound. 1
Trap&amp;rsquo;s signature sound has found a wide following all over the world. It is creating a legacy that is uniquely its own withing the context of the artist&amp;rsquo;s circumstances and social context.</description></item><item><title>Spooky Serenades</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/xv-10-20/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Oct 2020 19:48:52 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/xv-10-20/</guid><description>As we turn the corner of yet another quarantine month, time feels more like a fantastical construct each day and my household grasps for any ways of distinguishing this month from the last 6.¬†Consequentially, oc and I have been getting into the Halloween spirit more than we normally do (which was already a lot).

The squad hasn‚Äôt even met in close to six months. We‚Äôve all been fortunate enough to continue working from home however the lack of boundaries had made me feel more like a corporate drone lately. Day in and day out, it‚Äôs almost like we‚Äôre living a groundhog day scenario.

Finishing the series last weekend with my fellow boolers left me with every emotion, including the desire to bend elements.

Perhaps it‚Äôs as so many thinkers have said, that it is because of the vileness, or call it adversity, that such beauty does exist. (As balance?)‚Äù.

With all that&amp;rsquo;s going on in the world, Su Lee is the sonic physician we all need right now. Her song &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll Just Dance&amp;rdquo; was a viral hit on YouTube partly because of her dancing in her bedroom studio, but also because she was able to put to words the vibes of this crazy year and make us feel okay with it for once.</description></item><item><title>Drive the Boat</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/xv-05-07/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 May 2020 23:33:51 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/xv-05-07/</guid><description>One of the oldest motifs in hip hop is Hennessy‚Äîubiquitous in tracks from its inception through today. Rappers laud Hennessy as an aphrodisiac, the fuel for a wild night, a staple in daily life.¬†The golden hue and bottle emulate luxury yet Henny touts an accessibility to listeners and rappers alike.

With an upbeat melody and a catchy rhythm, Amy uses humorous and clever wordplay to deliver a grounded but harsh glimpse into what we conventionally identify as gold digging women.
Amy has the perspective of an outsider looking into the lives of these women. The track is a barrage of shortcomings that these women possess as they attempt to capture the high life but somehow they always seem to fall short.</description></item><item><title>Procaine hydrochloride</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/pb-04-02/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Apr 2020 21:43:04 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/pb-04-02/</guid><description>In these frantic times, you might walk through your drug store aisles, looking for Tylenol or Advil. You&amp;rsquo;ll walk by bare shelves and realize that everyone else cleared out the stock in a panic. Now there&amp;rsquo;s no reason to be upset‚Äîhidden away in the bottom shelf, you&amp;rsquo;ll find Acetaminophen and Ibuprofen. They&amp;rsquo;re generic versions of those medications, but they&amp;rsquo;re just as effective.

Even after 400 years, high schoolers everywhere can‚Äôt seem to shake his presence. His works are avidly studied and his themes manage to show up in the most unexpected places. The bard‚Äôs 16th century writing might seem like the furthest thing away from hip-hop but lately I‚Äôve been hearing references to complex Shakespearean characters in very clever ways.</description></item><item><title>Sadbois Need Love</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/posts/sadbois-need-love/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2020 10:48:59 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/posts/sadbois-need-love/</guid><description>The term sadboi has been taking hold within groupbool for some time now. It all started when pb was intervened by several people within the span of his bi-monthly blonde listening sessions. He elaborated this encounter further on his blog but in summary, he was defensive about being called a sadboi and went to great lengths to empirically prove that he&amp;rsquo;s not. However that situation got me wondering, aren&amp;rsquo;t we all sadbois in some respects, albeit some more than others?</description></item><item><title>leggo my lagos</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/sp-02-06/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2020 22:36:51 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/sp-02-06/</guid><description>On the coast of West Africa lies Nigeria, one of the populous countries in the world. It is an economic powerhouse with an emerging market that is on track to become a global super power.

Birthdays, milestones, relationships, jobs etc. For me, over the past several years, time is measured by Spotify playlists. Each playlist of mine is a time capsule that holds memories stirred by each song that comes on shuffle when I revisit it months, or even years later. Music is beautiful and powerful in that way. Below are three songs, each from a different playlist, that bring back only the happiest memories.</description></item><item><title>I got sunshine‚Ä¶</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/xv-02-06/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2020 00:35:35 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/xv-02-06/</guid><description>Music can be a conduit and amplifier for any mood: there are many a meme about listening to sad songs when you‚Äôre sad to make you sadder.¬†While their purpose is to provoke a chuckle from a passerby scroller, they hint at a powerful and universal effect music seems to have.¬†Songs enhance, highlight, and even create moods and feelings.

It is capable of fluidly traversing genres and make unconventional pairings sound right at home. This mostly speaks to a producer‚Äôs mixing prowess but also to the ability of the artist to supplement the original sample whether in relation to the subject matter or the sound itself. The artist is not simply using the sample as sonic filler but rather as an homage&amp;mdash;paying tribute to another as a jumping off point to their own ends.</description></item><item><title>Bollywood Bangers</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/pb-01-16/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2020 23:16:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/pb-01-16/</guid><description>Bollywood frequently gets written off as a second rate film industry - and for good reason. Most movies are poorly written and laughably acted cashgrabs. But every few years, a new movie comes out that equals if not surpasses Hollywood quality blockbusters. In my opinion, no director is better at producing these films than Sanjay Leela Banshali. His movies draw from epic periods in Indian history (albeit with a good bit of fictionalization and bias).</description></item><item><title>Tat on my ribs like‚Äî</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/oc-01-09/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2020 21:33:47 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/oc-01-09/</guid><description>I do not know what permanent is.
The artist behind each of these tracks has stolen my dream of Drake tattooing their likeness onto his body‚Äîas each have achieved a level of talent or fame worthy of him abandoning the will of his Jewish God to homage.

But its easy to empathize with the sincerity in their words when they write about their moms. Three artists from different eras with different styles that rap about wildly different topics. One consistent theme - their songs about their respective moms are some of their best.
Reminder to call your mom if you haven&amp;rsquo;t in a while.</description></item><item><title>Time Travel in Pink</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/xv-01-02/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2020 21:27:07 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/xv-01-02/</guid><description/></item><item><title>body and soul</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/sp-01-02/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2020 20:11:44 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/sp-01-02/</guid><description>The world will never see another Amy Winehouse again, she was one of a kind with unparalleled talent and musicality. Her emotional depth and her ability to convey deep and personal subject matters while fluidly traversing genre boundaries was other worldly.

I keep finding artists that embody her musical spirit in both tone and subject matter and it always leaves me a little bit emotional.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/oc-12-19/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2019 00:40:08 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/oc-12-19/</guid><description/></item><item><title>sound discovery</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/sp-12-19/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2019 00:32:29 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/sp-12-19/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/xv-12-12/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2019 22:51:09 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/xv-12-12/</guid><description/></item><item><title>stark honesty</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/sp-12-12/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2019 22:04:49 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/sp-12-12/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Drake Dilemma</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/posts/the-drake-dilemma/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Dec 2019 20:48:51 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/posts/the-drake-dilemma/</guid><description>There&amp;rsquo;s a running joke among the squad whenever one of us has Drake show up on the gb feed.

My love for this artist stems from her seamless transitioning: singing to rapping, english to spanish and back again. She weaves between styles gracefully and fluidly, no small feat for a 20 year old. Raised in Harlem, Melii was smooched by the limelight for the first time on Meek Mill&amp;rsquo;s album *Championships.*However, since then she has proven herself hella versatile and way more than a random feature:</description></item><item><title>jadedAtTwentyTwo</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/albums/jadedattwentytwo/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2019 23:08:45 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/albums/jadedattwentytwo/</guid><description>To my day one boolers, who&amp;rsquo;ve been booling with me through and through, here&amp;rsquo;s a mixtape bool.

The first thing that caught me off guard was the tone of her voice, a huskiness that parallels Amy and Lauryn, with a jazzy bend calling back to the likes of Eartha Kitt.
I wanted to look at two songs off of her EP Reminiscence. As the title insinuates, this EP revolves around love lost and lost love.</description></item></channel></rss>
