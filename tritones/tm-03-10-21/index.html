• Mar 11, 2021</div><div class=tritone-description><p>Others came before them, but Ice-T, Eazy-E, and King Tee helped put Gangsta music in the
consciousness of the mainstream. Previously, it was underground music, only for those in the know.
Ice-T would amuse his friends with what were called Crip Rhymes, short raps detailing the life in
the gang. These rhymes would later help form his hit &ldquo;6 N’ The Mornin&rdquo;. This song, along with
Eazy’s &ldquo;Boyz-N-The-Hood&rdquo;, and Tee’s &ldquo;Act A Fool&rdquo;, painted a picture of excess, violence, and
a certain hopelessness. The message of struggle was not new, but the delivery captured the
imagination of White America, in whose minds the Civil Rights movement had long since
achieved its objectives. Of course, any social change resulting from this renewed focus was
miniscule. What else could be expected in the Reagan-Bush era?</p><p>These three songs follow a similar lyrical format. Told almost as long-form stories, they
detail a day(s) in the life of someone from the neighborhood and in the lifestyle. Each
rapper uses his personal experience, as well as blends fiction with fact. Common themes emerge
across the songs: the car culture of California, weapons, drugs, and domestic violence.
As Eazy says, there are those who “[know] nothin in life but to be legit”. He and Ice-T examine
the potential consequences of this life in their songs: prison and death. King Tee does not
dwell on these negative aspects, however, saying: “I feel like a gangster and I just don’t care…”.</p><p>Another similarity between these three songs is the production. At this point in the
late 80s, the G-funk sound was still nascent and un-polished. As a result, the beats are more
strongly influenced by the disco or electronic scenes which proliferated throughout
Los Angeles at the time. As an example, elements of Dre’s previous electro act,
World Class Wreckin’ Cru, can be heard on the Boyz-N-The-Hood backing track. This creates an
interesting contrast: pioneering lyrical content over more familiar, of the time, beats.</p></div><div class=tritone-tracks><div class=tritone-track><a href=https://open.spotify.com/track/2cBOh97kgDenDOdtKhwU9O target=_blank><img src=https://storage.googleapis.com/gb-imgs/tritones/tm-03-10-21/2cBOh97kgDenDOdtKhwU9O.overlay.compressed.jpeg class=tritone-track-img></a><div class=tritone-track-title>6 'N the Mornin'</div><div class=tritone-track-artist>Ice-T</div></div><div class=tritone-track><a href=https://open.spotify.com/track/5RGXoZt1qxmAErdhbyKJKq target=_blank><img src=https://storage.googleapis.com/gb-imgs/tritones/tm-03-10-21/5RGXoZt1qxmAErdhbyKJKq.overlay.compressed.jpeg class=tritone-track-img></a><div class=tritone-track-title>Boyz-N-The-Hood</div><div class=tritone-track-artist>Eazy-E</div></div><div class=tritone-track><a href=https://open.spotify.com/track/5gzmjxuR0FI7Posk2FshBQ target=_blank><img src=https://storage.googleapis.com/gb-imgs/tritones/tm-03-10-21/5gzmjxuR0FI7Posk2FshBQ.overlay.compressed.jpeg class=tritone-track-img></a><div class=tritone-track-title>Act A Fool</div><div class=tritone-track-artist>King Tee</div></div></div></div></div></div><div class=container><footer><div class=footer-space></div><hr class=line-break><div class=footer-container><p><span class=footer-title><a href=/authors/ class=groupbool-title>groupbool</a></span><ul class=footer-media-links><li class=footer-media-links-item><a href=https://open.spotify.com/user/a3e3q1r71fxruc76p0r9o8eiy target=_blank><img src=/images/icons/spotify.png></a></li><li class=footer-media-links-item><a href=https://twitter.com/groupbool target=_blank><img src=/images/icons/twitter.svg></a></li><li class=footer-media-links-item><a href=https://github.com/groupbool target=_blank><img src=/images/icons/github.png></a></li></ul></p></div></footer></div><div id=shortcuts-root></div></body></html>
