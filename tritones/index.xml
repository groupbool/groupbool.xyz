Larry June‚Äôs album Out the Trunk orbits two motifs: citrus and his car.</description></item><item><title>Suspension of Disbelief</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/pb-11-19-2020/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Nov 2020 21:43:04 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/pb-11-19-2020/</guid><description>Imagine immersing yourself in a 1940&amp;rsquo;s biopic and the main character listens to K-pop all throughout the movie - sounds ridiculous right? Period pieces rely heavily on the soundtrack for immersion. The sounds of a movie set the auditory backdrop and allow you to fully engross yourself in the time period. With that being said, when the music starkly clashes with the time period, I find my attention fully focused on the character and their actions.</description></item><item><title>straight outta atl</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/sp-11-11-20/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Nov 2020 19:53:52 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/sp-11-11-20/</guid><description>Despite the east coast provenance of the hip hop scene, the southern lab has established itself as the genre&amp;rsquo;s powerhouse multiple times over the hop hop timeline. More recently, the trap artists coming out of ATL have taken the world by storm and finally cemented rap as the mainstream sound. 1
Trap&amp;rsquo;s signature sound has found a wide following all over the world. It is creating a legacy that is uniquely its own withing the context of the artist&amp;rsquo;s circumstances and social context.</description></item><item><title>Spooky Serenades</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/xv-10-20/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Oct 2020 19:48:52 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/xv-10-20/</guid><description>As we turn the corner of yet another quarantine month, time feels more like a fantastical construct each day and my household grasps for any ways of distinguishing this month from the last 6.¬†Consequentially, oc and I have been getting into the Halloween spirit more than we normally do (which was already a lot).
Our home is decked out in orange and cobwebs and my playlist has been sprinkled with spooky rap.</description></item><item><title>wagwan bruv</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/sp-10-08/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Oct 2020 18:28:24 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/sp-10-08/</guid><description>The novel coronavirus has brought upon an unexpected shift to our way of life. The squad hasn‚Äôt even met in close to six months. We‚Äôve all been fortunate enough to continue working from home however the lack of boundaries had made me feel more like a corporate drone lately. Day in and day out, it‚Äôs almost like we‚Äôre living a groundhog day scenario. This pandemic isn‚Äôt so much to blame but it has managed to compound my absurdist outlook.</description></item><item><title>Lessons in Bending</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/oc-06-11/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jun 2020 15:34:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/oc-06-11/</guid><description>Netflix released Avatar: The Last Airbender onto their streaming platform last month, and it couldn‚Äôt have come at a better time‚Äîproviding the perfect quarantine escape and touching on social plagues that have spanned generations. Finishing the series last weekend with my fellow boolers left me with every emotion, including the desire to bend elements. While water, earth, fire, and air bending are obviously not achievable in our physical world, they have plenty of familiar roots that can be tapped into.</description></item><item><title>American Music</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/jb-06-11/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jun 2020 00:06:01 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/jb-06-11/</guid><description>Amiri Baraka said it best: ‚ÄúOne of the most baffling things about America is that despite its essentially vile profile, so much beauty continues to exist here. Perhaps it‚Äôs as so many thinkers have said, that it is because of the vileness, or call it adversity, that such beauty does exist. (As balance?)‚Äù.
American music is black music. Listen, feel, and understand.</description></item><item><title>Su Lee</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/mg-06-05/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jun 2020 19:00:11 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/mg-06-05/</guid><description>The power of an artist is to feel the ailments of society and diagnose it before we even realize what‚Äôs going on. With all that&amp;rsquo;s going on in the world, Su Lee is the sonic physician we all need right now. Her song &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll Just Dance&amp;rdquo; was a viral hit on YouTube partly because of her dancing in her bedroom studio, but also because she was able to put to words the vibes of this crazy year and make us feel okay with it for once.</description></item><item><title>Drive the Boat</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/xv-05-07/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 May 2020 23:33:51 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/xv-05-07/</guid><description>One of the oldest motifs in hip hop is Hennessy‚Äîubiquitous in tracks from its inception through today. Rappers laud Hennessy as an aphrodisiac, the fuel for a wild night, a staple in daily life.¬†The golden hue and bottle emulate luxury yet Henny touts an accessibility to listeners and rappers alike. Hennessy accumulated an intense loyalty early on from the hip hop community because it was one of the only companies to hire black executives, and I‚Äôll drink to that ü•Ç</description></item><item><title>Procaine hydrochloride</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/pb-04-02/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Apr 2020 21:43:04 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/pb-04-02/</guid><description>In these frantic times, you might walk through your drug store aisles, looking for Tylenol or Advil. You&amp;rsquo;ll walk by bare shelves and realize that everyone else cleared out the stock in a panic. Now there&amp;rsquo;s no reason to be upset‚Äîhidden away in the bottom shelf, you&amp;rsquo;ll find Acetaminophen and Ibuprofen. They&amp;rsquo;re generic versions of those medications, but they&amp;rsquo;re just as effective. They might not have the eye catching marketing or the superior effectiveness we&amp;rsquo;ve been placebo&amp;rsquo;d into believing.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/xv-03-19/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Mar 2020 19:33:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/xv-03-19/</guid><description>In a ‚ÄúFair and Lovely‚Äù world where virtually every skincare product in the East is sold with lighteners, the dark skinned people of the world apply those creams, rinses, and even bleaches trying to be ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù; while in parallel their coveted light skinned counterparts slow roast themselves in tanning beds or under the sun with the same goal in mind&amp;hellip; the grass always seems to be greener.
This tritone celebrates the beauty of that darker skin ‚Äî as a chubby preteen with the darkest skin of all the girls in my family, self esteem was never really in abundance; an experience I regrettably share with countless kids around the world.</description></item><item><title>Shakespearean Sorrows</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/sp-03-12/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Mar 2020 23:21:40 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/sp-03-12/</guid><description>Shakespeare is revered for the universality of his themes that break geographic and class barriers. Even after 400 years, high schoolers everywhere can‚Äôt seem to shake his presence. His works are avidly studied and his themes manage to show up in the most unexpected places. The bard‚Äôs 16th century writing might seem like the furthest thing away from hip-hop but lately I‚Äôve been hearing references to complex Shakespearean characters in very clever ways.</description></item><item><title>leggo my lagos</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/sp-02-06/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2020 22:36:51 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/sp-02-06/</guid><description>On the coast of West Africa lies Nigeria, one of the populous countries in the world. It is an economic powerhouse with an emerging market that is on track to become a global super power. On top of this, Nigeria also has an incredible music scene with a cultural lineage that goes way back; from being at the forefront of early highlife to playing a major role in the development of afrobeat with the likes of the legendary Fela Kuti.</description></item><item><title>Time &amp; Space</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/oc-02-06/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2020 22:36:51 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/oc-02-06/</guid><description>Different people measure time in different ways. Birthdays, milestones, relationships, jobs etc. For me, over the past several years, time is measured by Spotify playlists. Each playlist of mine is a time capsule that holds memories stirred by each song that comes on shuffle when I revisit it months, or even years later. Music is beautiful and powerful in that way. Below are three songs, each from a different playlist, that bring back only the happiest memories.</description></item><item><title>I got sunshine‚Ä¶</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/xv-02-06/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2020 00:35:35 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/xv-02-06/</guid><description>Music can be a conduit and amplifier for any mood: there are many a meme about listening to sad songs when you‚Äôre sad to make you sadder.¬†While their purpose is to provoke a chuckle from a passerby scroller, they hint at a powerful and universal effect music seems to have.¬†Songs enhance, highlight, and even create moods and feelings.
Revisiting the idea of leaning on music when you‚Äôre feeling down, these three songs are my essentials for any rainy day.</description></item><item><title>uncut gems</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/sp-01-16/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2020 23:38:06 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/sp-01-16/</guid><description>One of my favorite aspects of hip hop has to be its versatility. It is capable of fluidly traversing genres and make unconventional pairings sound right at home. This mostly speaks to a producer‚Äôs mixing prowess but also to the ability of the artist to supplement the original sample whether in relation to the subject matter or the sound itself. The artist is not simply using the sample as sonic filler but rather as an homage&amp;mdash;paying tribute to another as a jumping off point to their own ends.</description></item><item><title>Bollywood Bangers</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/pb-01-16/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2020 23:16:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/pb-01-16/</guid><description>Bollywood frequently gets written off as a second rate film industry - and for good reason. Most movies are poorly written and laughably acted cashgrabs. But every few years, a new movie comes out that equals if not surpasses Hollywood quality blockbusters. In my opinion, no director is better at producing these films than Sanjay Leela Banshali. His movies draw from epic periods in Indian history (albeit with a good bit of fictionalization and bias).</description></item><item><title>Tat on my ribs like‚Äî</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/oc-01-09/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2020 21:33:47 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/oc-01-09/</guid><description>I do not know what permanent is.
The artist behind each of these tracks has stolen my dream of Drake tattooing their likeness onto his body‚Äîas each have achieved a level of talent or fame worthy of him abandoning the will of his Jewish God to homage.
Sade‚Äôs otherworldliness has earned her not one but two placements on Drake‚Äôs physical being‚Äîgiven her beauty and the influence of her sensual sound on tracks such as ‚ÄúI Couldn‚Äôt Love You More‚Äù.</description></item><item><title>mom's spaghetti</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/pb-01-09/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2020 08:08:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/pb-01-09/</guid><description>Its hard to relate on a personal level with rappers; most people don&amp;rsquo;t live through the same experiences that inspire these artists&amp;rsquo; music. But its easy to empathize with the sincerity in their words when they write about their moms. Three artists from different eras with different styles that rap about wildly different topics. One consistent theme - their songs about their respective moms are some of their best.
Reminder to call your mom if you haven&amp;rsquo;t in a while.</description></item><item><title>Time Travel in Pink</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/xv-01-02/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2020 21:27:07 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/xv-01-02/</guid><description/></item><item><title>body and soul</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/sp-01-02/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2020 20:11:44 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/sp-01-02/</guid><description>The world will never see another Amy Winehouse again, she was one of a kind with unparalleled talent and musicality. Her emotional depth and her ability to convey deep and personal subject matters while fluidly traversing genre boundaries was other worldly. Although she left this world too soon, she left behind an incredible legacy. I keep finding artists that embody her musical spirit in both tone and subject matter and it always leaves me a little bit emotional.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/oc-12-19/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2019 00:40:08 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/oc-12-19/</guid><description/></item><item><title>sound discovery</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/sp-12-19/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2019 00:32:29 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/sp-12-19/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/xv-12-12/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2019 22:51:09 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/xv-12-12/</guid><description/></item><item><title>stark honesty</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/sp-12-12/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2019 22:04:49 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/sp-12-12/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
