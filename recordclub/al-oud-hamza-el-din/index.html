It was a very minimal album,\nmostly just the voice and the oud, plus light percussion for some of the songs. ”The Spirits”\ndefinitely was the most melancholic. The standout for me was “Did Nura Remember”, it seemed\nvery emotionally charged.\n","I thought the album was varied despite the intimate production\nas Hamza almost seemed to explore different genres (through scales and structure).\nFor instance, “The Message Bearer” reminded me of soft Celtic guitars and\n“The Fortune Teller” resonated almost as a Hindu prayer/chant.\n"],"timestamp":"2021-01-26T12:08"},{"author":"tm","body":["Really enjoyed the album. The first track, Childhood, reminded me a bit of Earl Scruggs.\nWould have been interesting to hear the two of them together. Grandfather’s Stories was\nvery interesting too.
