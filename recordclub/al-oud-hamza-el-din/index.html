I&#39;m pretty much always down for a solo album.\nLots of space in the music, quite intimate, all that good stuff. I don&#39;t think the album\nis as strong as a cohesive unit as some of hamza&#39;s other albums, but I really like the\ndiversity of the song structures. The spirits is pretty obviously the heater of the\nbunch, heavy stuff. Grandfather&#39;s stories is a live expedition to craft a song out of\nunit structures. Strong vibes throughout. Good album to sit outside to.\n"],"timestamp":"2021-01-25"},{"author":"sp","body":["is it good for a dog hunting beans"],"timestamp":"2021-01-25"},{"author":"jgb","body":["Hmm good question","Doesn&#39;t capture the hunt quite right"],"timestamp":"2021-01-25"},{"author":"sp","body":["just curious, what did you mean by lots of space"],"timestamp":"2021-01-26"},{"author":"jgp","body":["It doesn&#39;t sound busy or overdone at all"],"timestamp":"2021-01-26"},{"author":"sp","body":["listened to the album, i know what you mean by intimate. It was a very minimal album,\nmostly just the voice and the oud, plus light percussion for some of the songs. ”The Spirits”\ndefinitely was the most melancholic. The standout for me was “Did Nura Remember”, it seemed\nvery emotionally charged.\n","I thought the album was varied despite the intimate production\nas Hamza almost seemed to explore different genres (through scales and structure).\nFor instance, “The Message Bearer” reminded me of soft Celtic guitars and\n“The Fortune Teller” resonated almost as a Hindu prayer/chant.\n"],"timestamp":"2021-01-26"},{"author":"tm","body":["Really enjoyed the album. The first track, Childhood, reminded me a bit of Earl Scruggs.\nWould have been interesting to hear the two of them together. Grandfather’s Stories was\nvery interesting too. It had a really cool flow: one note played at varying intervals\nleading into more complex flourishes, then back again.\n"],"timestamp":"2021-01-26"},{"author":"sp","body":["bluegrass definitely came to mind when listening"],"timestamp":"2021-01-26"},{"author":"jgb","body":["the clapping on the last track spooked me the first listen"],"timestamp":"2021-01-26"},{"author":"oc","body":["i spent last night and this morning listening to the album!
