I think the horn noise (possibly a shofar?) at the end really helps\nset the spiritual tone and melodically flows into the next track (possibly the two\nare in related keys).\n","“Ghost of Soulja Slim” was a standout track for me. The sampled melody goes real hard\nagainst the two Jays’ verses which is funny because it is a John Williams sample from\nValley of the Dolls. Jay Elec knows how to choose samples (see \"Dimethyltryptamine\"). The\nway he wrangles a snippet from an esoteric melody and creates something quintessentially\nhip-hop reminds of Yasiin Bey and a Tribe Called Quest from the 90s.\n","In the last track, “A.P.I.D.T.A” (All Praise Is Due To Allah), Jay samples\n“A Hymn” from the psychedelic band Khruangbin. This was probably my favorite as, like jgb,\nthe melancholy feels are very touching for me as well. I also really like how hov used\nform to derive meaning by\nchoosing to physically leave out the word “end” at the end “I screenshot &#39;em so I got &#39;em,\nI don&#39;t want this thing to—“.
