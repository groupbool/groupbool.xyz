This tritone celebrates the beauty of that darker skin — as a chubby preteen with the darkest skin of all the girls in my family, self esteem was never really in abundance; an experience I regrettably share with countless kids around the world.</description></item><item><title>I got sunshine…</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/xv-02-06/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2020 00:35:35 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/xv-02-06/</guid><description>Music can be a conduit and amplifier for any mood: there are many a meme about listening to sad songs when you’re sad to make you sadder. While their purpose is to provoke a chuckle from a passerby scroller, they hint at a powerful and universal effect music seems to have. Songs enhance, highlight, and even create moods and feelings.
Revisiting the idea of leaning on music when you’re feeling down, these three songs are my essentials for any rainy day.</description></item><item><title>Time Travel in Pink</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/xv-01-02/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2020 21:27:07 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/xv-01-02/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/xv-12-12/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2019 22:51:09 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/tritones/xv-12-12/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Melii</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/posts/melii/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Oct 2019 00:01:45 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/posts/melii/</guid><description>The second spanish baddie to be highlighted on groupbool: Melii stuns with both looks and lyricism.
My love for this artist stems from her seamless transitioning: singing to rapping, english to spanish and back again. She weaves between styles gracefully and fluidly, no small feat for a 20 year old. Raised in Harlem, Melii was smooched by the limelight for the first time on Meek Mill&amp;rsquo;s album *Championships.*However, since then she has proven herself hella versatile and way more than a random feature:</description></item><item><title>Meek Mill</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/posts/meek-mill/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2019 00:01:45 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/posts/meek-mill/</guid><description>When I first heard Meek Mill, I dismissed him as a non-unique, cookie cutter, misogynistic rapper that didn’t really bring anything new to the table and the only thing I knew about him is that he beefed with Drake. His voice was just so yell-ey and hard to digest because it felt more like he was chastising me than spitting bars.
HOWEVER, I feel v differently now! I want u guys to give him a chance too.</description></item></channel></rss>
