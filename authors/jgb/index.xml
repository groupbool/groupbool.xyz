In &amp;ldquo;The Shape of Jazz to Come&amp;rdquo; (1959, Atlantic), Ornette Coleman presents a nascent vision of the unburdened musicality which will become the revolutionary &amp;ldquo;free jazz&amp;rdquo; movement (although the producers added a self-imposed burden with that album title - quite a claim).

Perhaps it’s as so many thinkers have said, that it is because of the vileness, or call it adversity, that such beauty does exist. (As balance?)”.
American music is black music. Listen, feel, and understand.</description></item></channel></rss>
