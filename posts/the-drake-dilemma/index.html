<a href=/feed>feed</a>. We see it as a guilty pleasure that has finally been shoved into the spotlight for
the rest of squad to see. Ok it&rsquo;s not that dramatic and it&rsquo;s not I don&rsquo;t like
Drake as an artist. However some of the squad members (<a href=/authors/xv>xv</a> and <a href=/authors/oc>oc</a>)
get very <em>defensive</em> when we point it out, thus making the situation hilarious.</p><p>Truth be told, I have a lot of respect for Drake. He is a talented musician that has managed
to cut across all boundaries to be beloved by everyone. I think my inherent aversion to
something of so commercially popular and the repetitive <strong>sadboi™</strong> subject matter often
puts me on guard with him; but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that I haven&rsquo;t listened to
<a href=https://open.spotify.com/album/1lXY618HWkwYKJWBRYR4MK>passionfruit</a> on repeat&mdash;I&rsquo;m a sucker
for dancehall.</p><div class=spotify-embed-track><iframe src=https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5mCPDVBb16L4XQwDdbRUpz frameborder=0 allowtransparency=true allow=encrypted-media></iframe></div><h3 id=enter-feed-v10>Enter Feed v1.0</h3><p>The feed was <a href=/authors/pb>pb</a>&lsquo;s brain child for adding a dynamic element to gb. It
presents the artists in spotify that we have been listening to for all to see. It is periodically updated
to match our listening history in <em>near</em> real time. Spotify does not expose a streaming
API nor is it necessary as the financial and technical cost on our end would be cumbersome at
our current scale. Instead, we rely on spotify&rsquo;s
<a href=https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference-beta/#endpoint-get-recently-played>recently played tracks</a>
for the current user. This endpoint retrieves the last 50 tracks that the user has listened
to for at least 30 seconds.</p><p>We are using google&rsquo;s cloud platform for all of our backend components because they have
a very generous free tier. The feed is simply a <a href=https://storage.googleapis.com/gb-feed/feed/feed_preview.json>json file</a>
that is a map of a user to a their <em>recent</em> genres and artists. There is a cloud function
that is being invoked every hour that simply scrapes spotify for each user using the recent
tracks endpoint. It then reduces the tracks to the 5 most frequent artists and the 3 most popular
genres, creates the new json file, and dumps it to a storage bucket. Although not real-time,
updating the feed every hour did showcase a changing glimpse into the squad&rsquo;s listening history.</p><h3 id=the-dilemma>The Dilemma</h3><p>We all have that one artist that we keep going back to day in and day out. Their inescapable
sounds provides a fix for any situation during the day. Their effect is often compounded by
memories shaped during our formative years. For some, that artist is <strong>Drake</strong>. Because
we were reducing the recent tracks to the most frequent artists, xv&rsquo;s feed often had Drake
at the forefront. This was prime fodder for the running joke that xv only listened
to Drake. However, objectively speaking, xv listens to spotify more actively than the rest of
squad (she listened to a whopping 235,260 minutes of spotify this year alone) with artists
ranging from a wide set of genres.</p><p>Our feed was flawed in that it weighed the frequency of artists over diversity of the tracks
themselves. The feed is supposed to represent a snapshot of our tastes at a given point in time.
Each gb member has a heterogenous set of tastes with artists ranging from all over the world. We
wanted the feed to change as our listening history changed. Our feed however ended up giving
us a slightly <em>skewed</em> representation of our tastes.</p><h3 id=enter-feed-v11>Enter Feed v1.1</h3><p>More recently, we have been thinking of aggregating our listening history into an ad-hoc
spotify analytics component where we can gather interesting metrics on a user&rsquo;s feed such
as quantifying their genre tastes or determining how much of a <a href=https://www.prajal.xyz/posts/SadBoi>sadboi™</a>
they are. To support this and possible future endeavors, we switched to using
a <a href=https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview>pubsub</a> model to structure our feeds instead.</p><p>In order to separate concerns, we now have a different component for scraping a user
feed and generating a preview based on those fields (the feed
that you see on the site). The feeds scraped are limited to the last hour to avoid duplicating
previously seen tracks. The feed is published to a <code>feed</code> topic that ultimately triggers
the preview generation function.</p><p>Moreover, this time around the feed generation simply takes the most recent artists
from the current feed, prepends it to any existing artists in the feed, and takes
the first 5. This effectively ensures that the most recent artist from the scrape interval
will be present in the feed and finally rid us of <em>The Drake Dilemma</em>. To introduce more
activity on our feed, we also changed the scrape interval to 30 minutes.</p><p>We give our fellow boolers a hard time for being a Drake fan girl, however we should stop and
consider that maybe deep down we are all Drake fan girls as well.</p><div class="embed youtube-video"><iframe class=youtube-video-player type=text/html src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/epiW5dUErg8 frameborder=0 allowfullscreen></iframe></div><blockquote><p>He just really gets us</p></blockquote></article></section></div><footer><div class=footer-space></div><hr class=line-break><div class=footer-container><p><span class=footer-title><a href=/authors/ class=footer-title-link>groupbool</a></span><ul class=footer-media-links><li class=footer-media-links-item><a href=https://open.spotify.com/user/a3e3q1r71fxruc76p0r9o8eiy target=_blank><img src=/images/icons/spotify.png></a></li><li class=footer-media-links-item><a href=https://twitter.com/groupbool target=_blank><img src=/images/icons/twitter.svg></a></li><li class=footer-media-links-item><a href=https://github.com/groupbool target=_blank><img src=/images/icons/github.png></a></li></ul></p></div></footer></div></body></html>
