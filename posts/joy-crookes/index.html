singer songwriter from the UK. The first thing that caught me off guard was the tone of her voice,
a huskiness that parallels Amy and Lauryn, with a jazzy bend calling back to the likes of
Eartha Kitt.</p><p>I wanted to look at two songs off of her EP
<em>Reminiscence</em>
.
As the title insinuates, this EP revolves around love lost and lost love. Thematically,
Joy&rsquo;s song revolve around the same things that your run of the mill pop star would be lamenting
about; however she does it with a style and maturity way beyond her years.</p><h2 id=mans-world>Man’s World</h2><div class=spotify-embed-track><iframe src=https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/59oGmgXiWsC4BSkskZ1uhV frameborder=0 allowtransparency=true allow=encrypted-media></iframe></div><p>On the surface, this song is a rejection of the significant other and a promotion of self reliance.</p><blockquote><p>Pathetic with the fallacy</p><p>Fantasizing what the storm would do to me</p><p>Tornado hit the bedroom</p></blockquote><p>Joy seems to be critiquing her past self for abandoning her ideals for more physical
aspects of a relationships. She showcases her brilliance with wordplay here by using
multiple layers of imagery. <em>Fantasizing</em> relates to something that is desired however
she is yearning for a <em>storm</em>, a word generally associated with disturbance and upheaval.
This goes back to the idea that she is actively pursuing a path of self destruction
despite understanding the pitfalls. Another layer of meaning pertains to more physical
cravings, she has a way to be so explicit with such harmless words.</p><p>The self reliance, however, breaks down at different points of the song because the
listed coping mechanisms are inherently unsustainable.</p><blockquote><p>I find my love in red wine</p><p>No chaser</p><p>I get by with my liquor and my paper</p></blockquote><p>Starting with the chorus she’s replacing the man with other vices. However, the vices
become more involved in the later verse.</p><blockquote><p>Candy Crush and Novacane</p><p>I&rsquo;m guessin&rsquo; that the purple didn&rsquo;t need the rain</p></blockquote><p>She’s distracting herself with media and medication. I’m assuming that the purple refers to
lean and is a neat Prince reference. There’s more to verse two but I haven’t understood the
deeper context yet. This song is a conflict between being in loving and loving
someone. This is echoed in earlier songs of the album as well. These two concepts are not
the same and at times mutually exclusive. These coping mechanisms are shields to the vulnerable
person underneath. This vulnerability can be seen in the next song <em>Don’t Let Me Down</em>.</p><p>The sample in the end is an interview with Eartha Kitt. The interviewer asked her if she
would be willing to compromise for a man in her life, which she finds hysterical and is
downright defensive. At one point she even says “I want someone to love me with me.”
This unflinching attitude is what Joy is trying to put up but the deeper context infers
that it’s probably not working.</p><h2 id=dont-let-me-down>Don’t Let Me Down</h2><div class=spotify-embed-track><iframe src=https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/42Lf6mnwqlz19jkGqhjsW0 frameborder=0 allowtransparency=true allow=encrypted-media></iframe></div><p>There is so much open vulnerability in this song that it&rsquo;s utterly moving. I find
it a bit hard to relate to some aspects but the universality of unflinching affection stands out.
The verses outline a deteriorating relationship that Joy has a hard time justifying because
of the intimacy they shared in the past.</p><blockquote><p>I know you&rsquo;re the type to tip waiters with all your emotions</p></blockquote><p>I wasn’t sure what this line meant but the repetition probably insinuates significance.</p><blockquote><p>Rolling up</p><p>Cos my high is never enough</p></blockquote><p>This seems like a response to Man’s World in regards to how the vices couldn’t replace the
romance. Although, it might also be speaking to how she can’t be fulfilled thus the
relationship was doomed from the beginning.</p><p>Here is another example of the lyrical cleverness. She manifests a moment of
intense vulnerability in just two lines, to the point where I get chills everytime
I hear it.</p><blockquote><p>In the night I set my legs open</p><p>Made sure all my defences were broken</p></blockquote><p>Although the unrequited aspect of this relationship makes me think that the sentiment is
still a bit juvenile, she shows maturity by realizing that infatuation is fleeting and
your perception of a relationship changes over time, which is something I think
we can all relate to.</p><blockquote><p>Now you&rsquo;re fleeting</p><p>Like the smoke</p><p>Or our summers on Spanish coasts</p></blockquote><p>In the end, it’s a bit sad that she’s subjected to the whims of someone else and she
resorts to pleading for loyalty. But I have to admire the poetic aspect of it and the level
of devotion that she herself has shown.</p><div class="embed youtube-video youtube-video-spaced"><iframe class=youtube-video-player type=text/html src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/UIxmuRbwjoY frameborder=0 allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Lastly, I would recommend you check out the music video. The minimal production seeks
to highlight her struggles in focus. The multiple hands are an obvious callback to
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasudhara>Vasudhara</a>
(the bodhisattva of wealth, prosperity, and abundance) although the analogy is ironic
because the song does not insinuate prosperity. Perhaps it was just an aesthetic.
This was the limit of my understanding but perhaps you guys can shed more light into the deeper
subtext.</p></article></section></div></div><div class=container><footer><div class=footer-space></div><hr class=line-break><div class=footer-container><p><span class=footer-title><a href=/authors/ class=groupbool-title>groupbool</a></span><ul class=footer-media-links><li class=footer-media-links-item><a href=https://open.spotify.com/user/a3e3q1r71fxruc76p0r9o8eiy target=_blank><img src=/images/icons/spotify.png></a></li><li class=footer-media-links-item><a href=https://twitter.com/groupbool target=_blank><img src=/images/icons/twitter.svg></a></li><li class=footer-media-links-item><a href=https://github.com/groupbool target=_blank><img src=/images/icons/github.png></a></li></ul></p></div></footer></div></body></html>
