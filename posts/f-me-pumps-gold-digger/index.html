With an upbeat melody and a
catchy rhythm, Amy uses humorous and clever wordplay to deliver a grounded but harsh glimpse
into what we conventionally identify as <strong>gold digging</strong> women.</p><p>Amy has the perspective of an outsider looking into the lives of these women. The track is a
barrage of shortcomings that these women possess as they attempt to capture the high life but
somehow they always seem to fall short.</p><blockquote><p>He could be your whole life</p><p>If you got past one night</p><p>But that part never goes right</p></blockquote><p>Despite the humorous wordplay throughout the track, the lifestyle that we find is quite depressing.
The track details a lifestyle that slowly fades away after the “gold diggers” have served their
purpose of populating the clubs and keeping the nightlife alive. At first, I interpreted the song
as a cautionary tale but Amy released Frank when she was 20, far too young to have been at the
other side of this pumped up lifestyle.</p><blockquote><p>Without girls like you</p><p>There&rsquo;s no nightlife</p><p>All those men just go home to their wives</p></blockquote><p>Beneath the glitzy surface of this track, what remains is a deeply saddening glimpse into a
lifestyle that Amy somehow manages to humanize while at the same time undercutting with backhanded
compliments. She is characterizing someone that possesses no substance behind the shimmer.
The most depressing aspect of which is that this shimmer slowly fades with age and leaves
these women with lived experiences with nothing to really show for it.</p><blockquote><p>Don&rsquo;t be mad at me</p><p>Cuz you&rsquo;re pushing thirty</p><p>And your old tricks no longer work</p></blockquote><p>Amy’s lyrical prowess shines through as she grounds this unrelenting lifestyle further with
mini arcs in the gold digging lifestyle that always leaves them hanging. She does this so
playfully that it’s almost distracting from the depressing tales.</p><blockquote><p>So you did Miami</p><p>Cause you got there for free</p><p>But somehow you missed the plane</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>You did too much E</p><p>Met somebody</p><p>And spent the night getting caned</p></blockquote><p>Caned is british slang for stoned and apart from the obvious insinuation it might also be a
general characterizing of the individual as spacey and being out of it.</p><p>However, through the satire, there is a sense of respect that Amy seems to have for these women.
She constantly characterizes their unrelenting pursuits and highlights their grind. Each lyrical
unit within a verse contains a mini narrative describing a persevering figure that simply moves
forward from each action to the next. Someone that is truly living in the moment being guided by
their ambitions of finding that prince charming. Amy outlines a vapid figure that never manages
to get very far.</p><h2 id=driving-off-in-a-hyundai>Driving off in a hyundai</h2><div class=spotify-embed-track><iframe src=https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1PS1QMdUqOal0ai3Gt7sDQ frameborder=0 allowtransparency=true allow=encrypted-media></iframe></div><p>“Gold Digger”, off of <em>Late Registration</em> (2005), is unarguably one of old Kanye’s most
popular singles. It features Jamie Foxx on the hook interpolating Ray Charles’ “I Got a Woman”
by completely reversing the original intent of the song.</p><blockquote class=translated-block><div class=translated-block-row><div class=translated-block-col><p>She take my money when I’m in need</p></div><div class="translated-block-row translated-block-row-alternate"><p>She gives me money, when I’m in need</p></div></div><div class=translated-block-row><div class=translated-block-col><p>Yeah she's a trifling friend indeed</p></div><div class="translated-block-row translated-block-row-alternate"><p>Yeah, she's a kind of friend indeed</p></div></div><div class=translated-block-row><div class=translated-block-col><p>Oh she's a gold digger way over town</p></div><div class="translated-block-row translated-block-row-alternate"><p>I got a woman, way over town</p></div></div><div class=translated-block-row><div class=translated-block-col><p>That digs on me</p></div><div class="translated-block-row translated-block-row-alternate"><p>That's good to me, oh yeah</p></div></div></blockquote><p>This track has bouncy 808s with handclaps overlayed on top of a classic soul sample that is
extremely upbeat. Kanye’s whimsical verses deliver three associated narratives describing the
relationship between a “Gold Digger” and a man that ultimately results in disaster. This track
is a shift in perspective from “F*ck Me Pumps” as Kanye raps from the perspective of (verse 1)
and about (verse 2) a man “afflicted” by a gold digger. His tongue in cheek narrative, that is so
emblematic of old Kanye, sets up a self assured woman that actively takes advantage of her man
in some really shady ways.</p><p>The first verse is from the perspective of a naive Kanye that is smitten by a “Cutie the bomb”
and is actively looking for her. Similar to Amy, he starts off characterizing her at the surface
level. Note that the current setting is actually a <em>beauty salon</em>. Similar to Amy, he first
identifies her with a designer handbag.</p><blockquote class=translated-block><div class=translated-block-row><div class=translated-block-col><p>Met her at a beauty salon</p></div><div class="translated-block-row translated-block-row-alternate"><p>And the men notice you</p></div></div><div class=translated-block-row><div class=translated-block-col><p>With a baby louis Vuitton under her arm</p></div><div class="translated-block-row translated-block-row-alternate"><p>With your Gucci bag crew</p></div></div></blockquote><p>Nevertheless Kanye is blinded to the red flags e.g. the baggage with the existing kids,
the expensive demands, and the fact that they have been affiliated with both Busta and Usher,
who are coincidentally both wealthy 🤔. He is completely infatuated with physical
traits so he falls victim like the unlucky fella in the next verse.</p><blockquote><p>It take too much to touch her</p><p>From what I heard she got a baby by Busta</p><p>I don’t care what none y’all say I still love her</p></blockquote><p>In the second verse, Kanye takes an outsider’s perspective reflecting on a future with the
relationship that might have started in the previous verse. The perspective shift is probably
due to the fact that these verses were written separately and only later
combined.</p><blockquote><p>18 years, 18 years</p><p>She got one of your kids, got you for 18 years</p></blockquote><div class="embed youtube-video"><iframe class=youtube-video-player type=text/html src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/jq1h0O48k90 frameborder=0 allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Kanye characterizes the man as having been subjugated by the woman by having to pay child
support until the kid reaches maturity at eighteen years. Through this verse, the power dynamic
is uneven with the woman wielding most of the advantage as her “&mldr; car and crib is bigger than his”.
Kanye comedically drives this point home talking about a football player successful on the field
but still has to drive home in a “hyundai” suggesting that he’s suffering a loss paying either
child support or alimony.</p><blockquote><p>You will see him on TV any given Sunday</p><p>Win the Superbowl and drive off in a Hyundai</p></blockquote><p>The woman incessantly abuses the man’s resources for superficial gains like plastic surgery and
cars. Kanye advises that the only way to account for this spell is to sign a prenuptial agreement
otherwise leading to the climax, where the man finds out that the kid he was supporting for
eighteen years wasn’t even his. Old kanye delivers such vivid imagery using pop culture
similes that the verse plays out like a scene from a movie, a recurring trait of
<em>Late Registration</em> in general.</p><p>Throughout this track, the power dynamic is on the side of the woman. Kanye characterizes
her as an exploitative individual while the man is a hapless fool being trudged along in
her cons. However Kanye completely shifts the narrative in the third verse, now about a
loyal woman that is sticking by her man despite his destitute situation.</p><blockquote><p>You go out to eat, he can’t pay y’all can’t leave</p><p>There’s dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves</p></blockquote><p>She “[sticks] by his side” as the man is mopping floors while working towards his ambition.
She stays right while the man makes it into a Benz from a Datsun. A Datsun was a low-cost vehicle
that fits the narrative here as a beater car. This verse describes an honest and true woman that
supports her man however Kanye sets up one of his most poignant lines off of the whole track.
One that feels like a knife in the back.</p><blockquote><p>And when you get on he leave your ass for a white girl</p></blockquote><p>“Gold Digger” can be seen not just as a specific slight on gold digging women but rather about
honest people getting played by selfish individuals leaving them in the dust. Kanye is also
making a point about how successful men tend to desire trophy wives by giving into their base
desires and abandoning the good ones that helped them reach their pedestal in the first place.
I don’t think Kanye is denegrating interracial relationships but rather relationships that are
instigated by vanity and he’s using the concept of a “white girl” as a mainstream standard of
beauty. This will consequently result in a repeat of previous verses resulting in the same
vicious cycle once more. In an ironic twist Kanye ended up marrying Kim Kardashian, make of
it what you will.</p><p>This stellar line reminds of a particular scene in the afro-surrealist masterpiece, Atlanta.
In an episode revolving around a group of friends supposedly partying in champagne papi’s house.
One of the characters confronts a celebrity&rsquo;s (white) girlfriend about being a
“black man accessory.” It’s such an honest jab at feminine beauty ideals and its
relationship with race.</p><div class="embed youtube-video"><iframe class=youtube-video-player type=text/html src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/BG5KUrO3sPE frameborder=0 allowfullscreen></iframe></div><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Both “Fuck Me Pumps” and “Gold Digger” are narratives on gold digging women. The artists
mostly take an outsider&rsquo;s perspective and provide an honest glimpse into this lifestyle. They
both share an upbeat bouncy beat that parades as a catchy tune but are both portraying a tiring,
parasitic lifestyle that is more depressing than a first listen would let on.</p><p>Amy’s take is more humanizing throughout, although not blameless. She sets up a relentless
lifestyle of an individual using their vanity, represented with physical objects and beauty
standards, for financial self gain. However the narrative she builds can’t help but have you
empathize with these women. Although her tone at the end is one of slight respect, she never
lets on to a redeeming quality and the sympathy turns into a case of schadenfreude.</p><p>Kanye’s approach builds up the gold diggers as an antagonistic figure and the only sense of
sympathy is for the people that get conned along the way. His first two verses revolve around an
unlucky man however the way the track is set up, you see that Kanye views this story as a cycle.
One where honest people lose out because of our baseless pursuits of vanity and materialism.
There is no sympathy for the man because their position is brought forth by their own volition.
This track can be viewed as a greater narrative about how we all end up as victims of
societal expectations.</p></article></section></div><footer><div class=footer-space></div><hr class=line-break><div class=footer-container><p><span class=footer-title><a href=/authors/ class=footer-title-link>groupbool</a></span><ul class=footer-media-links><li class=footer-media-links-item><a href=https://open.spotify.com/user/a3e3q1r71fxruc76p0r9o8eiy target=_blank><img src=/images/icons/spotify.png></a></li><li class=footer-media-links-item><a href=https://twitter.com/groupbool target=_blank><img src=/images/icons/twitter.svg></a></li><li class=footer-media-links-item><a href=https://github.com/groupbool target=_blank><img src=/images/icons/github.png></a></li></ul></p></div></footer></div></body></html>
