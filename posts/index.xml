It’s a sound that completely envelops you and after the track is over, you immediately jump to play it again. For me, Jon Piers is one of these artists. Their songs turn heads with their auteur production and keep you hooked with the elusive lyrics.
Hailing from Woodbridge, VA (shoutout nova), Jon Piers is, as listed on his Spotify bio, another alternative artist trying to get a foothold.</description></item><item><title>F Me Pumps / Gold Digger</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/posts/f-me-pumps-gold-digger/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Apr 2020 18:42:30 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/posts/f-me-pumps-gold-digger/</guid><description>That part never goes right “Fuck Me Pumps” is a track off of Amy Winehouse’s debut album, Frank. With an upbeat melody and a catchy rhythm, Amy uses humorous and clever wordplay to deliver a grounded but harsh glimpse into what we conventionally identify as gold digging women.
Amy has the perspective of an outsider looking into the lives of these women. The track is a barrage of shortcomings that these women possess as they attempt to capture the high life but somehow they always seem to fall short.</description></item><item><title>Sadbois Need Love</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/posts/sadbois-need-love/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2020 10:48:59 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/posts/sadbois-need-love/</guid><description>The term sadboi has been taking hold within groupbool for some time now. It all started when pb was intervened by several people within the span of his bi-monthly blonde listening sessions. He elaborated this encounter further on his blog but in summary, he was defensive about being called a sadboi and went to great lengths to empirically prove that he&amp;rsquo;s not. However that situation got me wondering, aren&amp;rsquo;t we all sadbois in some respects, albeit some more than others?</description></item><item><title>The Drake Dilemma</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/posts/the-drake-dilemma/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Dec 2019 20:48:51 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/posts/the-drake-dilemma/</guid><description>There&amp;rsquo;s a running joke among the squad whenever one of us has Drake show up on the gb feed. We see it as a guilty pleasure that has finally been shoved into the spotlight for the rest of squad to see. Ok it&amp;rsquo;s not that dramatic and it&amp;rsquo;s not that I don&amp;rsquo;t like Drake as an artist. However some of the squad members (xv and oc) get very defensive when we point it out, thus making the situation hilarious.</description></item><item><title>Melii</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/posts/melii/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Oct 2019 00:01:45 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/posts/melii/</guid><description>The second spanish baddie to be highlighted on groupbool: Melii stuns with both looks and lyricism.
My love for this artist stems from her seamless transitioning: singing to rapping, english to spanish and back again. She weaves between styles gracefully and fluidly, no small feat for a 20 year old. Raised in Harlem, Melii was smooched by the limelight for the first time on Meek Mill&amp;rsquo;s album *Championships.*However, since then she has proven herself hella versatile and way more than a random feature:</description></item><item><title>Higher Brothers</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/posts/higher-brothers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/posts/higher-brothers/</guid><description>Higher Brothers (MaSiWei, DZ, Psy.P, Melo), a chinese hip hop group, collaborate with Florida rappers, Ski Mask the Slump God and Denzel Curry on &amp;ldquo;One Punch Man&amp;rdquo;. Ski Mask and Denzel have been known to make references to anime in their own works and this has become a growing motif reaching a full swell with the rise of SoundCloud rap. The late XXXTentacion is a quintessential example of this idea and the magnitude of his impact on the younger generation of rap listeners is indisputable.</description></item><item><title>Rosalía pt. 1</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/posts/rosalia/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/posts/rosalia/</guid><description>Every few years there&amp;rsquo;s a new wave of artists that steamrolls the music industry. A handful of artists make it big: they garner a viral following, they sell out shows, and they make millions. Then there&amp;rsquo;s one artist out of the handful that revolutionizes music. We play their songs over and over again, chasing the adrenaline that sweeps us when they take the stage. Their music is like acoustic opioids, and we return to it time after time to make us truly feel something.</description></item><item><title>summer</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/posts/summer/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jun 2019 11:36:18 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/posts/summer/</guid><description>A season characterized by warm weather, good vibes and a distinct lack of seasonal affective disorder. I genuinely think that people can be circumstantially shown to be happier during the summer time.
This idea starts when we are too young to actualize the world, in the form of long and blissful breaks. Months of free time without the encumbrance of school. Free time to sit around, explore ourselves and discover new relationships.</description></item><item><title>Ari Lennox</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/posts/ari-lennox/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/posts/ari-lennox/</guid><description>My trip with xv to Dreamville Fest this past weekend is inspiration for today’s artist of the week… Ari Lennox! The only female artist signed with J. Cole. Inarguably (xv won’t argue) the most talented and stacked label in the game right now, Ari holds her own and she proved that to me this weekend.
Ari’s someone I’ve respected for a few years now, since I was introduced to her sound on Revenge of the Dreamers II.</description></item><item><title>Meek Mill</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/posts/meek-mill/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2019 00:01:45 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/posts/meek-mill/</guid><description>When I first heard Meek Mill, I dismissed him as a non-unique, cookie cutter, misogynistic rapper that didn’t really bring anything new to the table and the only thing I knew about him is that he beefed with Drake. His voice was just so yell-ey and hard to digest because it felt more like he was chastising me than spitting bars.
HOWEVER, I feel v differently now! I want u guys to give him a chance too.</description></item><item><title>Joy Crookes</title><link>https://groupbool.xyz/posts/joy-crookes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2019 23:30:25 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://groupbool.xyz/posts/joy-crookes/</guid><description>I’ve got an interesting artist for you guys today: Joy Crookes, a 20 year old up and coming singer songwriter from the UK. The first thing that caught me off guard was the tone of her voice, a huskiness that parallels Amy and Lauryn, with a jazzy bend calling back to the likes of Eartha Kitt.
I wanted to look at two songs off of her EP Reminiscence. As the title insinuates, this EP revolves around love lost and lost love.</description></item></channel></rss>
