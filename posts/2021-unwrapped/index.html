Let&rsquo;s a take look back at our feed from this past year. Spotify unwrapped already gave us a high level preview of our listening habit however I wanted to break it down into more granular metrics with monthly breakdowns.</p><p>I goofed and forgot to store the feed for all of June üôÉ so the following breakdown is a missing some data but the sadboi vibes are still ever present.</p><h2 id=db>db</h2><p>For divz, 2021 was the year of <span class=bool>doja</span>. She listened to doja at least <span class=bool>132</span> times. However her most listened to song was a binaural relaxation track, &ldquo;Alpha Alpha&rdquo;. This was a common trend among other boolers as well. That brown noise really drowns out the humdrum of quarantine.</p><figure class="page-imgs page-imgs-right"><img class=custom-img src=https://storage.googleapis.com/gb-imgs/2021-unwrapped/db-top-songs.png></figure><p>Apart from doja, db was really vibing with Maluma and Priya Ragu. Both of them really have insanely catchy rhythms. Mamula more reggaeton and although Priya is a little hard to define, I would say more afrobeat influenced. In total, db listened to <span class=bool>1600</span> unique artists and <span class=bool>1961</span> unique songs throughout this year.</p><figure class="page-imgs page-imgs-right"><img class=custom-img src=https://storage.googleapis.com/gb-imgs/2021-unwrapped/db-top-artists.png></figure><p>Lastly, db&rsquo;s listening patterns showed peaks in apr and sep. I bet she was laser focused during these months üòâ.</p><figure class="page-imgs page-imgs-right"><img class=custom-img src=https://storage.googleapis.com/gb-imgs/2021-unwrapped/db-monthly-duration.png></figure><h2 id=jgb>jgb</h2><p>I don&rsquo;t know where to begin with this mans other than how he has opened my eyes to some of the most genre-bending and unique artists out there (shout out Gio) througout the years. Hands down the most eclectic music taste among the group.</p><p>What I truly respect about jgb is that he&rsquo;s fearless about exploring any given genre. He comes in with no assumptions and lets the artists lead the course. Not to say that he vibes with everything out there&mdash;I&rsquo;ll get him to appreciate JPEG&rsquo;s genius one of these days.</p><p>While this man is going down a new rabbit hole, reggae and free jazz are never far behind. Still this year looks like jgb was going through an ambient music phase with the likes of <span class=bool>Max Richter</span> and <span class=bool>Steve Halpern</span>.</p><figure class="page-imgs page-imgs-right"><img class=custom-img src=https://storage.googleapis.com/gb-imgs/2021-unwrapped/jgb-top-artists.png></figure><p>The top songs here are but one source of jgb&rsquo;s listening activity because of course he&rsquo;s the biggest record head that I know. I&rsquo;d be willing to bet that his true top tracks probably includes some <em>Dance Hall Style</em> from <span class=bool>Horace Andy</span> but obviously in wax.</p><figure class="page-imgs page-imgs-right"><img class=custom-img src=https://storage.googleapis.com/gb-imgs/2021-unwrapped/jgb-top-songs.png></figure><p>Curious what happened here but looks like jgb increased his spotify intake as the year progressed. Maybe his record supply started dwindling as the pandemic resurfaced üòù. He listened to a total of <span class=bool>598</span> songs and <span class=bool>2210</span> songs on spotify this year.</p><figure class="page-imgs page-imgs-right"><img class=custom-img src=https://storage.googleapis.com/gb-imgs/2021-unwrapped/jgb-monthly-duration.png></figure><h2 id=oc>oc</h2><p>oc hunkered down this year with loads of lofi bumps with <span class=bool>eevee</span> mixed with more ethereal soundscapes like <span class=bool>huma</span>; perfect for hanging out with nigel. Also who would have thought that <span class=bool>Calming Cat Music</span> was just smooth jazz. I say we blow nigel&rsquo;s mind with some Alice Coltrane üòâ.</p><figure class="page-imgs page-imgs-right"><img class=custom-img src=https://storage.googleapis.com/gb-imgs/2021-unwrapped/oc-top-artists.png></figure><p>oc probably had the most evenly distributed top songs among the crew. A lot of the songs were sleep tracks that were probably played in the background. I&rsquo;m not sure if going by frequency is the best way to determine interesting artists that someone listened to as I&rsquo;m sure spotify is filtering out most &ldquo;background music&rdquo; somehow although that seems like a hard problem. We can compare against next year&rsquo;s data to potentially gauge <em>new</em> artists.</p><figure class="page-imgs page-imgs-right"><img class=custom-img src=https://storage.googleapis.com/gb-imgs/2021-unwrapped/oc-top-songs.png></figure><p>oc listened to a total of <span class=bool>4071</span> new artists and <span class=bool>6187</span> new songs this year. That&rsquo;s an incredible volume of music. I&rsquo;ll need to ask her for any artists that caught her eye as she always has the sickest recs. I will be forever grateful to oc for introducting me to Jessie Ware last year (disco is definitely not dead).</p><p>Her spotify intake was also pretty consistent with the track distribution as there was mostly consistent use throughout the year peaking around Q3. I guess fall really is the time to go hard.</p><figure class="page-imgs page-imgs-right"><img class=custom-img src=https://storage.googleapis.com/gb-imgs/2021-unwrapped/oc-monthly-duration.png></figure><h2 id=pb>pb</h2><p>pb is probably the most committed to artist among the crew. When he takes a liking, man goes all in quickly ramping up the listening counts. Our resident sadboi was fully devoted to <span class=bool>Lana</span> this year, listening to her a whopping <span class=bool>895</span> times. Even beating out the background noise runner up <span class=bool>High Altitude Samples</span>.</p><p>Quick aside: pb and I have a running joke that Lana looks like a different person in every picture. The one continuity is that she always has a forlorned look waiting for a conceptual husband-like figure who&rsquo;s out on a business trip, never to return; all the while chain smoking an inordinate amount of cigs. Far out I know, but really feels like the vibe her music evokes üò≠.</p><p><span class=bool>Rosalia</span> was not far behind. Not surprising considering pb was among 1% of her top listeners in 2020. This mans was definitely fiending some <em>El Mal Querer</em> on repeat.</p><figure class="page-imgs page-imgs-right"><img class=custom-img src=https://storage.googleapis.com/gb-imgs/2021-unwrapped/pb-top-artists.png></figure><p>Lately, pb has really been into the new french wave coming out of Belgium with the likes of <span class=bool>Ang√®le</span> and <span class=bool>Swing</span>. &ldquo;Up&rdquo; really hooked pb this year, understandably so, considering he listened to <span class=bool>Cardi</span> for a little over 9 hours. I guess if it&rsquo;s up, then it&rsquo;s really up.</p><figure class="page-imgs page-imgs-right"><img class=custom-img src=https://storage.googleapis.com/gb-imgs/2021-unwrapped/pb-top-songs.png></figure><p>pb&rsquo;s spotify really peaked around apr but I assume this was in the throes of his GRE preparation. Well it paid off so here&rsquo;s to never having to take another standardized test again. Our mans is moving to the west coast soon so from everyone here at gb, we&rsquo;re wishing him the best of luck. Groupbool is finally bi-coastal.</p><figure class="page-imgs page-imgs-right"><img class=custom-img src=https://storage.googleapis.com/gb-imgs/2021-unwrapped/pb-monthly-duration.png></figure><h2 id=xv>xv</h2><p>The most prolific spotify user within the group, xv broke the record again this year with a whopping <span class=bool>213,241</span> minutes spent listening to spotify. That&rsquo;s 148 days spent listening to music; more than a third of a year. She listened to a total of <span class=bool>4432</span> artists and <span class=bool>9476</span> songs.</p><figure class="page-imgs page-imgs-right"><img class=custom-img src=https://storage.googleapis.com/gb-imgs/2021-unwrapped/xv-top-artists.png></figure><p>As a permanent resident of cole world, <span class=bool>J. Cole</span> was unsurprisingly her number one. One of my favorite memories with xv is driving back from college, binging <em>2014 Forest Hills Drive</em> while hyper analyzing every song. It was a study in Cole and probably a very early iteration of groupbool. She was definitely bumping a lot of <em>The Off-Season</em> this year.</p><p>I was debating if I should mention it but the <a href=/posts/the-drake-dilemma/>drake dilemma</a> makes a seeming return üòù. Honestly same tho because Drake majorly bumps. One of my co-workers finally explained that cryptic <em>Certified Lover Boy</em> cover, the whole album is baby making music and Drake really wanted to make sure that it came across lol.</p><p>Our boy <span class=bool>Isaiah Rashad</span> finally made a glorious return this year. Honestly, worth the wait but still wish we got to see him with the TDE crew couple years back üôè. Throwback to when I blasted &ldquo;4 Da Squaw&rdquo; at full volume at work not realizing my headphones were not plugged in‚Äîno ragrets.</p><figure class="page-imgs page-imgs-right"><img class=custom-img src=https://storage.googleapis.com/gb-imgs/2021-unwrapped/xv-top-songs.png></figure><p>Similar to oc, xv had a fairly uniform distribution of frequent songs and her counts for the top songs were not as high as one might expect. I think xv listens to a constant rotation of tracks from varying artists and albums, thus the insane intake, and does localize to particular songs. Although pretty sure, the <span class=bool>Peng Black Girls</span> remix has been up there since last year. Check out the colors <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW_UHYs3giU">episode</a> if you haven&rsquo;t already, definitely a whole vibe.</p><figure class="page-imgs page-imgs-right"><img class=custom-img src=https://storage.googleapis.com/gb-imgs/2021-unwrapped/xv-monthly-duration.png></figure><p>No surprises with xv&rsquo;s spotify intake. Pretty high consistently throughout the year. I think the dip around Q3 is due to data loss rather than lack of activity. If you&rsquo;re not already impressed with xv&rsquo;s listening habits, consider that she told me she does not leave spotify playing through the night ü§î.</p></article></section></div></div><div class=container><footer><div class=footer-space></div><hr class=line-break><div class=footer-container><p><span class=footer-title><a href=/authors/ class=groupbool-title>groupbool</a></span><ul class=footer-media-links><li class=footer-media-links-item><a href=https://open.spotify.com/user/a3e3q1r71fxruc76p0r9o8eiy target=_blank><img src=/images/icons/spotify.png></a></li><li class=footer-media-links-item><a href=https://twitter.com/groupbool target=_blank><img src=/images/icons/twitter.svg></a></li><li class=footer-media-links-item><a href=https://github.com/groupbool target=_blank><img src=/images/icons/github.png></a></li></ul></p></div></footer></div><div id=shortcuts-root></div></body></html>
