Ski Mask and Denzel have been known to make references to anime in their own works and this has become a growing motif reaching a full swell with the rise of SoundCloud rap. The late XXXTentacion is a quintessential example of this idea and the magnitude of his impact on the younger generation of rap listeners is indisputable.</p><p>XXXTentacion grew up with Denzel Curry and collaborated a plethora of times with Ski Mask throughout their careers, but anime references are reflected in non-SoundCloud artists as well. Frank Ocean references Majin Buu in &ldquo;Pink Matter&rdquo;, Childish Gambino references Super Saiyan Goku in &ldquo;My Shine&rdquo;, and Kanye West&rsquo;s music video for &ldquo;Stronger&rdquo; is inspirated by the critically acclaimed anime film, Akira.</p><p>Personally, I am very fond of anime. If well done, it serves as an escape. Obviously an escape from reality like all entertainment, but also from the limits we place on ourselves mentally as we grow up without placing significant importance on creativity and imagination. It has a similar nostalgic appeal to childhood cartoons, however often times way more thought-provoking with wildly imaginative depictions that are seldom replicated in real-life forms of visual entertainment. It pushes the metaphorical envelope for what is fathomable to our inner child by depicting the unique Ubermensch-esque superpowers and values of the beloved protagonists.</p><p>Its self-evident to me how special it is and I think its beautiful that is holds true regardless of ethnocultural backgrounds. I&rsquo;m Moroccan, Denzel & Ski Mask are of Bahamian and Jamaican descent, respectively, almost every character depicted in Japanese animes look like they had Anglo-Saxon ancestors and yet we are all fully on board the anime bandwagon. The appeal of anime transcends surface level identifications (weeaboo, nerd, virgin, etc).</p><p>Contrary to anime, rap is overtly copacetic nowadays. It literally took over Rock as the top dog music genre. Even the average joe white dude can bump certified bangers about slinging dope and popping off at his 9-5 (probably a closeted n-word utterer though).</p><div class="embed youtube-video youtube-video-spaced"><iframe class=youtube-video-player type=text/html src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/XASNM1XEQPs frameborder=0 allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>It&rsquo;s a gritty, empowering and fluid form of human expression that has inspired a plethora of alternative subgenres.</p><p>Alright. Now that the anime and rap context is out the way, lets look at some muh-fucking lyrics dawg.</p><blockquote><p>[Verse 1: MaSiWei]</p><p>What you talkin&rsquo; about?</p><p>Wack shit, fake shit, sorry I don&rsquo;t get it</p><p>Sit your ass down just look how we make it</p><p>I know I&rsquo;m best rapper since I was 20</p><p>I don&rsquo;t wanna hear it cause&rsquo; you&rsquo;re dirty</p><p>I be like a birdman I&rsquo;m a bird</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know it but I can learn</p><p>I just want the money I swear</p></blockquote><p>MaSiWei is saying regardless differences in native tongue, he can mimick and improve on the bullshit that rappers earn recognition from in their raps. He touts his potential by virtue of being young (20). He also references co-founder of Cash Money Records, Birdman, and adlibs a &lsquo;brrd&rsquo; onomatopoeia. Undoubtedly hackneyed play by several names, mumble rap or otherwise (Cardi B, Lil Pump, any rapper who tries to simulate a phone call in a song, etc).</p><blockquote><p>[Verse 2: DZ]</p><p>~ English Translation:</p><p>I swear, I swear, I going too deep</p><p>I’m a professional, you’re not</p><p>Buy an AP, Hublot, Patek Philippe</p><p>Diamond studded stars, Swiss craftsmanship</p><p>You never see Chinese drippin, ok</p><p>I got ideal, I never obey</p><p>Fuck what you think, keep talking about me</p><p>If I’m in the company, it’ll never go bankrupt</p></blockquote><p>DZ&rsquo;s verse is a full flex. Starting off by repeating his first 2 words creates a strong musical motive and the lyrics afterwards flow well if listened to in the original language. &lsquo;Chinese drippin&rsquo; and other displays of opulence in this verse are undeniably inspired from American rap influence.</p><blockquote><p>[Verse 3: DZ & MaSiWei]</p><p>~ English Translation:</p><p>One punch man, I’ll give you a punch in the face</p><p>Everyone’s scared they crawl to the side</p><p>I’m so pissed my veins are gonna burst</p><p>I’m like your nemesis, I’ll whoop your ass when I see you</p><p>I’m gonna keep exploring, never stop going higher</p><p>What are you saying? Can’t hear you</p><p>So many bright lights, my neck is full of pearl chains</p><p>So comfortable, I’m smiling</p></blockquote><p>The protagonist that the song is named after is referenced to exaggerate the flex because he defeats any enemy with one punch. Always. The extreme imagery of vein&rsquo;s bursting is very anime-esque (going super saiyan bruh). In the last line, the English phonetic pronounciation for &lsquo;I&rsquo;m smiling&rsquo; sounds like &lsquo;shawty&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m still unclear if this was intentional. Perhaps. I mostly appreciate how so much more information seems to be unpacked per syllable in Chinese lol.</p><blockquote><p>[Verse 4: Ski Mask the Slump God]</p><p>My feet no Morty but Rick, Owens</p><p>What I tiptoe with my big, toe in</p><p>Scary side posted like scare, crowin&rsquo;</p><p>I&rsquo;m at yo&rsquo; head like a hair, sew in</p><p>Hide-and-seek where is your hair, line going?</p><p>Make the AK sound like some titties I motorboated</p><p>Can&rsquo;t bite my sauce &lsquo;cause it&rsquo;s poison coated</p><p>My flow gets you going like locomotive</p><p>Is you deaf, bitch? (Is you deaf?)</p><p>Watch your step, bitch (Watch your step)</p><p>How I pull the pistol, pop it like a nigga got a millionaire wrist (Ouch, ouch)</p><p>Higher predicted it, you should count a nigga album bitch</p><p>You done little bitch (Ooh! Ouch!)</p><p>Hotter the nigga sauce hit the beat like it&rsquo;s a fuckin&rsquo; One Punch Man fist? (Bitch! Woosh)</p></blockquote><p>First line is a reference to critically acclaimed cartoon series Rick & Morty as well as fashion designer Rick Owens. The following well-rhymed lines are taunts and insinuations that his opponents are nervous in his presence. He juxtaposes sex and death by comparing the sound of an automatic rifle&rsquo;s bullets to the sound of him rasberrying boobies (motorboating). He implies that he&rsquo;s immune to poison he ingests. And he flexes a bit more before closing the verse with a One Punch Man reference.</p><blockquote><p>[Verse 5: Denzel Curry]</p><p>Keep a .45, no Colt</p><p>Niggas get to runnin&rsquo; like they Usain Bolt</p><p>Give a nigga wings, give a nigga Red Bull</p><p>If a nigga die then I might be Deadpool</p><p>Five to your face like I&rsquo;m Abraham Lincoln</p><p>I leave a hole that&rsquo;s the size of a penny</p><p>When I Cascade they gon&rsquo; say that it&rsquo;s Denny</p><p>Pay off the witness they say I&rsquo;m at Denny&rsquo;s</p><p>Call me Goku</p><p>I play the numbers just like sudoku</p><p>Triple zero&rsquo;s making hella ovals</p><p>Overpaid but bitch I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; postal</p><p>I dress to kill and y&rsquo;all niggas formal</p><p>Magic on me, trick, I&rsquo;m Dumbledore</p><p>Open your back up you lookin&rsquo; like Bulbasaur</p><p>Bitch I&rsquo;m tyrannical, go in tyrannosaurus</p><p>Stupid ass nigga you know that&rsquo;s a metaphor</p><p>(Haha haha haha)</p></blockquote><p>Colt 45 is a malt liqour brand and .45 is an automatic colt pistol, Denzel lets us know he&rsquo;s talking about the latter. He does a good job of stringing seemingly unrelated references when developing his cold-blooded narrative. His foes have to run fast [like olympic sprinter Usain Bolt] or fly away with wings [from Red Bull slogan] to escape his reach. Deadpool is an American superhero who decimates his enemies brutally. Denzel uses Abraham Lincoln&rsquo;s representation on 2 forms of American currency to illustrate lethal threats via firearms. Also adds that he&rsquo;ll be fine because he can pay off people to support an alibi. He&rsquo;s not afraid to take risks or gamble with his own life (playing numbers) because he feels lucky like magic from Dumbledore (Harry Potter reference ha). Finally, he closes with a violent pokemon double entendre. Opening a back up in the sense of filling someone with bullets, but also Bulbasaur opens his back up when he releases his best move, Solar Beam. Bulbasaur is also a dinosaur inspired pokemon, hence the &ldquo;tyrannosaurus metaphor&rdquo;.</p><blockquote><p>[Verse 6: Psy.P]</p><p>Super Saiyan, yah, Hokage Ninja in my heart</p><p>Naruto (Naruto), Goku (Goku), you weak as cold food (Cold food)</p><p>Murder you like cutting tofu (Tofu)</p><p>Swaggering down South Renmin Road</p><p>Normal people don’t understand my attitude</p><p>Higher Gang’s vibes</p><p>Besides Brother’s riches I don’t care about anything</p></blockquote><p>The idea of the Super Saiyan from Dragon Ball Z can be thought of as &ldquo;serious mode&rdquo; for a fighter where all powers and abilities are amplified. The Hokages in Naruto are the highest tier ninjas of each of their respective villages and essentially govern all citizens below them. Psy.P is saying he only cares about his own strength and the workings of the Higher Brothers gang.</p><blockquote><p>[Verse 7: Melo]</p><p>Higher gang swag young rapper don&rsquo;t know how to be a man</p><p>Purple fire, purple juice, the swag in studio B</p><p>Still be the whole lot of money dance</p><p>Blessing blessing, flexing flexing, hoe</p><p>Many fashion flow yeah</p><p>Endangered animal, yeah</p><p>Become international fuck no love, cash only</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>[Outro: Psy.P & Melo]</p><p>You need to pay I&rsquo;m VVIP (Psh) free (Free)</p><p>I&rsquo;m a little bit tired my money&rsquo;s multiplying</p><p>Dunkin&rsquo; from three I&rsquo;m running my way (Okay)</p><p>In too many different place, and you need face to face</p></blockquote><p>Melo is taking a similar approach to MaSiWei, by imitating conventional rap notions by indulging in purple intoxicants, flexing his wealth and emphasizing other attributes of life exclusive to celebrities (wearing endangered animals and getting into VIP places for free). He also says he can dunk from the three point line which is cool if its true, but I feel like its more of a homage to basketball&rsquo;s presence in rap music.</p><div class="embed youtube-video youtube-video-spaced"><iframe class=youtube-video-player type=text/html src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/3gU_Cj37OwQ frameborder=0 allowfullscreen></iframe></div></article></section></div></div><div class=container><footer><div class=footer-space></div><hr class=line-break><div class=footer-container><p><span class=footer-title><a href=/authors/ class=groupbool-title>groupbool</a></span><ul class=footer-media-links><li class=footer-media-links-item><a href=https://open.spotify.com/user/a3e3q1r71fxruc76p0r9o8eiy target=_blank><img src=/images/icons/spotify.png></a></li><li class=footer-media-links-item><a href=https://twitter.com/groupbool target=_blank><img src=/images/icons/twitter.svg></a></li><li class=footer-media-links-item><a href=https://github.com/groupbool target=_blank><img src=/images/icons/github.png></a></li></ul></p></div></footer></div></body></html>
