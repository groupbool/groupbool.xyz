It‚Äôs a sound that completely envelops you and after the track is over, you immediately jump
to play it again. For me, Jon Piers is one of these artists. Their songs turn
heads with their auteur production and keep you hooked with the elusive lyrics.</p><p>Hailing from Woodbridge, VA (shoutout nova), Jon Piers is, as listed on his Spotify bio,
another alternative artist trying to get a foothold. Describing him as yet another alternative
artist is a gross simplification. Do yourself a favor and go listen to
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lBxZb4negU">&ldquo;Buzz&rdquo;</a> right now. They have managed
to showcase absolute range despite their limited body of work. I first heard of Jon through a mutual
friend. &ldquo;Buzz&rdquo; took me by surprise‚Äîthe sound was familiar yet the layered production felt so unique.
It‚Äôs a serious jam, and I‚Äôm sure I have already racked up a couple of hours listening to it on
Spotify. Jon Piers, recently released their second single <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beORDKVIbY8">&ldquo;red flag&rdquo;</a>
and we had an opportunity to sit down and talk about all things music. Hearing the context around
songs straight from the artist was a surreal experience.</p><p>Jon got their start playing the drums in church growing up. The drummer mindset is evident in
their songs, as they are very groove-oriented. When I asked where they take inspiration from, Jon said
that it‚Äôs random shit that just hits him, their exact words were ‚Äúit just falls out of the sky‚Äù
and they&rsquo;re just there as an antennae. They‚Äôve always had melodies and rhythms in their head and when
Jon was younger, they used to record himself vocalizing what a beat would sound like. There is always
that gap between what we want to create and what our abilities allow. Jon describes their growth
as a musician as an iterative process, tinkering until their musical ideas could be reified and
that gap could be closed.</p><h2 id=smiles><em>smiles</em></h2><p>One of Jon‚Äôs early musical ventures is their EP <a href=https://soundcloud.com/oniers/sets/smiles><em>smiles</em></a>
on SoundCloud. This was a very personal release that was conceived out of the monotony of working
at a moving company (ye&rsquo;s Spaceship vibes). The production is minimal, with a certain focus on
conventional song structure however you can tell that there is something else to
their layering skills. Jon does not shy away from interesting changes and they seamlessly showcase
both their melodic and rapping abilities. The entire vibe of the EP is Jon voicing his discomfort
with haters, relationships, and their then situation. They describes it as trying to do away with
the cloud in front of their eyes, and channelling their drive as a testament to what they could
create. &ldquo;blk brd&rdquo; is seriously a high key vibe üòâ.</p><div class=soundcloud-embed-track><iframe width=100% height=100 scrolling=no frameborder=no allow=autoplay src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/541769280&auto_play=false&hide_related=true&show_comments=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe></div><p>Jon said that they found <em>smiles</em> to be pure self expression. Their friends
obviously knew Jon beforehand, but they said that his friends really <strong>saw</strong> him after releasing
this EP.</p><p><img src=https://storage.googleapis.com/gb-imgs/posts/jon-piers/jon-piers-3.jpg alt=jon-piers-3></p><p>Lately, Jon hasn‚Äôt released much but they‚Äôre still making tons of music. As a creative, their bar
is very high and they&rsquo;re always tinkering with their productions. This balancing act of perfection and
something satisfactory is always difficult and as Jon described himself as ‚Äúhistorically, shit at
releasing‚Äù it made me think of Frankie.</p><h2 id=buzz>Buzz</h2><div class="embed youtube-video youtube-video-spaced"><iframe class=youtube-video-player type=text/html src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/8lBxZb4negU frameborder=0 allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>&ldquo;Buzz&rdquo; builds up on an 80s drum machine loop that is immediately reminiscent of the Darkwave Duchess
(more specifically <a href=https://open.spotify.com/track/4SExof7SNMmYgTmgE8TBrE>&ldquo;Fruit&rdquo;</a>). Jon said that
this was the exact vibe they were going for. They wanted to reference that feel while giving props
to ABRA. Jon mentioned that they really vibe with the 80s sound, and we talked at length about how
it‚Äôs coming back in interesting ways with the likes of <em>After Hours</em>.</p><p>&ldquo;Buzz&rdquo; is a serious bop, it‚Äôs groovy and unassuming but really packs a narrative punch. It‚Äôs about
buzzing, that fleeting feeling of floating and misguided intentions; more specifically, a buzzed
person contacting the narrator when under the influence.</p><blockquote><p>I know you buzzin</p><p>Steady hitting my line</p></blockquote><p>The upbeat tone of the song creates this seeming dynamic where the narrator is playing off of
calling this person out for their pattern of seeking companionship during the off hours with the
wrong intentions. However, reading into the <a href=https://genius.com/Jon-piers-buzz-lyrics>lyrics</a>
a bit, the narrator comes across as very vulnerable and the entire premise just seems depressing
for both parties. The narrator is appalled with this person‚Äôs behavior and understands that
it‚Äôs unhealthy.</p><blockquote><p>You ain‚Äôt listen when I told you fall back</p><p>Boundary where you found me, yeah you saw that</p></blockquote><p>However, the narrator is vulnerable, perhaps due to their own insecurities, and deliberates giving
into their weakness because ultimately they want companionship and are willing to look past
this behavior. Something I‚Äôm sure we could all relate to.</p><blockquote><p>Only cuz I&rsquo;m weak</p><p>Not focused on my needs</p><p>Just missing company, cuz you know Im on my own (oooh)</p></blockquote><p>You can find the narrator actively trying to find confirmation within himself in order to excuse
this behavior. They are trying to find an image in their mind of a proper and valid relationship
and end up projecting something that‚Äôs not there.</p><blockquote><p>Flipping through my mind</p><p>Searching for reminders</p><p>Subbing for sublime</p></blockquote><p>There is some prime imagery and wordplay early on. Jon uses the color green to symbolize a healthier
time in their relationship, using green leaves as a metaphor. They follow it up with rustling
leaves, which is more common during the fall when the trees wither away‚Äîan analogy of their
relationship. Thus, falling back into this is especially disheartening.</p><blockquote><p>Back when seeing you and green was all that</p><p>The rustle of the leaves, i could fall back to you</p></blockquote><p>This might be a total reach but there is something lyrically special behind this track that
can‚Äôt be totally explained.</p><p><img src=https://storage.googleapis.com/gb-imgs/posts/jon-piers/jon-piers-4.jpg alt=jon-piers-4></p><p>Jon said that they wrote the lyrics first, and then worked on the music. The original beat of the
song had a darker, melancholic feel (more like &ldquo;red flags&rdquo;), with the mood matching the narrative
more closely. However, channeling different artists they were listening to at the time, such as
Brent Faiyaz and ABRA, they restructured and completely changed the texture of the song. This
created some ambiguity around the message of the song and the feelings involved. In one sense,
perhaps this internal back and forth within the narrator is what it is, and the upbeat
melody makes it ok. Elusive indeed.</p><h2 id=red-flag>red flag</h2><div class="embed youtube-video youtube-video-spaced"><iframe class=youtube-video-player type=text/html src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/beORDKVIbY8 frameborder=0 allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Jon said that they weren‚Äôt even going to release &ldquo;red flag&rdquo;‚Äîit was going to be shelved üò±. We have their
girlfriend, Genesis, to thank for this phenomenal track as she ultimately convinced him to put it out
there. This track‚Äôs premise is more straightforward, it‚Äôs a short lament about ignoring red flags
in a relationship and how they ultimately come to regret it.</p><blockquote><p>I should‚Äôve</p><p>Listened to you back then</p></blockquote><p>It‚Äôs got an interesting structure where the whole song is basically a single verse bookended with
the chorus. Aside from the obvious premise, the verse enters a Poe-esque territory where the woman
is exaggerated and personified as a killer, possibly in the literal sense with actual skeletons in
the closet; and the victim is none other than the narrator as they are left ‚Äúswimming in dirt.‚Äù
However in the end, the final demise is on the narrator himself as they were warned by the woman
but failed to acknowledge it due to their naivety in thinking they could fix it.</p><blockquote><p>Love blind me looked over said, ‚Äúlook I can heal her‚Äù</p><p>If I&rsquo;m honest, couldn‚Äôt fault you fully, told me as i entered</p></blockquote><p>I spent a long time absorbing this song just from the production standpoint. It‚Äôs a totally
different vibe than &ldquo;Buzz&rdquo;, which Jon said was purposeful, as they wanted the listener to not be
reminded of their earlier works and wanted to really showcase their range. I love that the texture
of the song is so unconventional. The closest box I guess is alternative R&B but the samples
he uses and the way the vocal filters come together really make this track stand out. I also love
the minor production choices Jon made that really contribute to the overall texture, e.g. the
lighter flicks and the reversed sample acting as the bass drum in the beginning.</p><h2 id=futura-free>Futura Free</h2><p>We ended our conversation by just talking about our favorite artists. We were exploring all the
artists that we seriously vibe with and Jon said something that has stuck with me for a while now.
The artists that they (and myself for that matter) always keep coming back to are the ones that channel
the underground ethos. This isn‚Äôt limited to independent artists that few people know of, but
rather artists with the spirit of the underground that never become complacent and live at the
edge of discomfort. Artists that are pushing himself and seeking fulfillment through creating
dope music.</p><p>Some artists come up without it and others end up losing it, however, only artists with the spirit of
the underground are able to make good shit. Someone embodying this ethos from day one for both of
us is obviously none other than Frank Ocean. Honestly we ended up discussing blond/blonde for
over twenty minutes.</p><p><img src=https://storage.googleapis.com/gb-imgs/posts/jon-piers/jon-piers-5.jpg alt=jon-piers-5></p><p>It‚Äôs hard to characterize a <em>favorite</em> song off this album but Jon said that &ldquo;Ivy&rdquo; really spoke to
him. They&rsquo;d never heard a song like that before.</p><div class=spotify-embed-track><iframe src=https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2ZWlPOoWh0626oTaHrnl2a frameborder=0 allowtransparency=true allow=encrypted-media></iframe></div><blockquote><p>The effects on the guitar, the way the song goes, the bareness of it, the different effects to
it. There‚Äôs so much energy at the end, the way he screams the word trouble; it‚Äôs all so moving,
the crashing of the guitars, everything he was talking about was so specific; I get it</p></blockquote><p>For Jon, Frank is one of their favorite artists, because he‚Äôs beyond bold on his albums and has the
courage to be so vulnerable. They gave the example of this line from &ldquo;Self Control&rdquo;; enough said:</p><blockquote><p>Keep a place for me, for me</p><p>I&rsquo;ll sleep between y&rsquo;all, it&rsquo;s nothing</p></blockquote><p>Jon is actively working on an upcoming EP, Like the Lagoon, as their first major project. Sometimes
artists release eponymous albums named after themself. Since Jon is not just another alternative artist,
they&rsquo;re respecting this tradition with their own twist. Let me just leave it at the fact that Jon‚Äôs
birth color is blue. They&rsquo;ve been working on this for a while and, knowing Jon‚Äôs drive to constantly
challenge himself, I can only imagine how many versions of tracks they&rsquo;ve been through. Regardless of
when it arrives, I already know that it‚Äôs going to be a serious vibe and I can‚Äôt <code>expletive</code> wait.</p></article></section></div></div><div class=container><footer><div class=footer-space></div><hr class=line-break><div class=footer-container><p><span class=footer-title><a href=/authors/ class=groupbool-title>groupbool</a></span><ul class=footer-media-links><li class=footer-media-links-item><a href=https://open.spotify.com/user/a3e3q1r71fxruc76p0r9o8eiy target=_blank><img src=/images/icons/spotify.png></a></li><li class=footer-media-links-item><a href=https://twitter.com/groupbool target=_blank><img src=/images/icons/twitter.svg></a></li><li class=footer-media-links-item><a href=https://github.com/groupbool target=_blank><img src=/images/icons/github.png></a></li></ul></p></div></footer></div><div id=shortcuts-root></div></body></html>
