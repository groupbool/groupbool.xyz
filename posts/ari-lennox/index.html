of the week… Ari Lennox! The only female artist signed with J. Cole. Inarguably (xv won’t argue)
the most talented and stacked label in the game right now, Ari holds her own and she proved that
to me this weekend.</p><p>Ari’s someone I’ve respected for a few years now, since I was introduced to her sound on
Revenge of the Dreamers II
. Seeing her
performance this past weekend really elevated that level of respect for me. I think it’s one
thing for an artist to drop some fire shit on Soundcloud, Spotify, etc. It’s another thing
entirely to show yourself up on a live stage.</p><p>Ari’s one of those rarer cases where a performer sounds better live than they do
on a prerecorded track. Getting to actually witness Ari in her element brought her music full
circle for me. She truly embodies the values and ideals that her music, and the Dreamville label,
speak to. She’s a natural beauty and the artist she chooses to be, in a culture where what’s fake
is made to seem real and attainable, shows me what it really looks like to be a woman today.
Unapologetic, sexually empowered, vulnerable, natural, and moisturized.</p><p>Two songs that really speak to these elements…</p><h2 id=backseat-ft-cozz>Backseat (ft. Cozz)</h2><div class=spotify-embed-track><iframe src=https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1x5JgDICDtKgssNo8HIvYb frameborder=0 allowtransparency=true allow=encrypted-media></iframe></div><p>The song on <em>Revenge of the Dreamers II</em> that I mentioned turned me onto Ari.
This song is fun and dirty in the best way. I don’t necessarily think that it’s rare to hear
female artists talk so brazenly about sex (s/o Cupcakke)
on their tracks, but I do think it’s rare to hear it done so elegantly and in such an
empowering way. Ari’s so candid on this song about what it is SHE wants. I love this energy and
also s/o car sex.</p><h2 id=whipped-cream>Whipped Cream</h2><div class=spotify-embed-track><iframe src=https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/56IszkEOG5lFShWevvEH3R frameborder=0 allowtransparency=true allow=encrypted-media></iframe></div><p>This is the song where that element of vulnerability comes into play for me.
I think I’ll just let the lyrics speak for themselves,
but I have to give her mad credit with the lyricism here. She makes something shitty
sound so beautiful. The emotion in her vocals ughhh… crying at my desk thinking about this one.</p></article></section></div></div><div class=container><footer><div class=footer-space></div><hr class=line-break><div class=footer-container><p><span class=footer-title><a href=/authors/ class=footer-title-link>groupbool</a></span><ul class=footer-media-links><li class=footer-media-links-item><a href=https://open.spotify.com/user/a3e3q1r71fxruc76p0r9o8eiy target=_blank><img src=/images/icons/spotify.png></a></li><li class=footer-media-links-item><a href=https://twitter.com/groupbool target=_blank><img src=/images/icons/twitter.svg></a></li><li class=footer-media-links-item><a href=https://github.com/groupbool target=_blank><img src=/images/icons/github.png></a></li></ul></p></div></footer></div></body></html>
